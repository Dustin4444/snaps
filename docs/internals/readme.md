# Internals reference

In this documentation we will describe the internals of MetaMask Snaps, for
reference while developing or debugging. This document is not intended for
developers using snaps, but for developers working on the MetaMask Snaps
platform itself.

The purpose of this document is to provide an in-depth understanding of the internal workings of the MetaMask Snaps platform. It covers various components, their interactions, and the overall architecture of the system. This information is crucial for developers who are contributing to the development and maintenance of the MetaMask Snaps platform.

It is recommended to read the [architecture](./architecture.md)
document first, as it provides a high-level overview of the system.
